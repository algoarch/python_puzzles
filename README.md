# Python Puzzles
  Welcome to the open-source master repository of all the programming puzzles. We will maintain high-quality coding standards, detailed analysis and description of the algorithms, different solutions with varying complexity and efficiency.

  This project is a Work-In-Progress[WIP], and the repo will be updated on a regular basis. Feel free to use the code for your educational purposes.

  We do no encourage using this code during coding interviews and exams. It is highly unethical to do plagiarism during a contest or exam. You are doing it at your own sole discretion if you are copying this code for contests or exams. We are in no way responsible for any damage caused in doing so.

## Directory Structure
  The entire repository is divided into top-level directories which are the broader topic areas. Currently, the following topics are covered:
  1. Data Structures and Algorithms
  2. Mathematics
  3. Machine Learning

  We will be adding more topics as the project evolves and we get more support from the community.
